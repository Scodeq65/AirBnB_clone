Project Description
The AirBnB clone project aims to develop a command-line interface (CLI) tool similar to AirBnB's backend system. This project focuses on implementing a command interpreter to manage AirBnB objects such as users, states, cities, places, etc. The command interpreter will facilitate creating, retrieving, updating, and deleting these objects, providing a foundation for building subsequent components of the AirBnB clone.

Command Interpreter Description
The command interpreter is a Python script named console.py that allows users to interact with the AirBnB objects through a CLI interface. It follows the specifications outlined in the project requirements.

How to Start the Command Interpreter
To start the command interpreter, follow these steps:

1. Clone the repository to your local machine.
2. Navigate to the project directory.
3. Run the console.py script using Python 3.

How to Use the Command Interpreter
Once the command interpreter is running, you can use the following commands:

 - help: Display help information about available commands.
 - quit or EOF: Exit the command interpreter.
 - Other commands: Perform operations such as creating, retrieving, updating, or deleting AirBnB objects.
